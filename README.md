# Hello World.

### What it is.
A catalog of K-Nation member profiles.

### Why it exists.
An introduction to the world of code. <br/>
The purpose of this repo is twofold; First, to allow member to introduce themselves
in a meaningful way to the rest of the developer community. It's also a trial of sorts as members will have to do a 
bit of legwork to make their first contribution.

### How to contribute.
Adding your profile to the catalog is in concept quite simple, but can be daunting for a noob.
